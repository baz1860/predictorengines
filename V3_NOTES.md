# V3 Implementation Notes

Dated log of the V3 build (see `V3_PLAN.md`). One entry per milestone: files
changed, what was verified, and any rejected approaches. Scope for this pass is
the M1–M4 risk-reduction core (the plan's recommended time-box).

---

## 2026-06-15 · M1 — Common engine contract + contract tests

**Goal:** make all four engines speak one stable app contract before any
modelling change.

**Files changed**

- `app/engines/contracts.py` *(new)* — dependency-free contract helpers:
  - `assert_finite_json()` / `is_finite_number()` — reject NaN/Inf and any
    non-JSON value anywhere in a payload.
  - `validate_prediction()` — accepts outcomes-style (1X2/win-loss) *or*
    table-style (golf head-to-head) predictions.
  - `validate_table()` — `{columns, rows}` structure check.
  - `market_id()` — stable market identifiers (also normalizes golf's
    `side`-carried markets like `matchup:a|b`).
  - `fixture_key()` — deterministic `date|home|away[|competition]` event id.
  - `normalize_edge_row()` / `normalize_edge_result()` — **additive**
    normalization to the canonical edge shape, preserving each engine's existing
    UI keys so `columns` keep rendering unchanged. Sanitizes stray non-finite
    floats to `None` on the live path.
  - Canonical fields: `event_id, match_date, home, away, market, side, line,
    bet, odds, p_model, p_market, p_book, edge, ev_per_unit, kelly_frac,
    stake_gbp, source, model, recommended`.
- `app/engines/worldcup.py`, `cfb.py`, `club_soccer.py`, `golf.py` — each
  `edge()` now returns `normalize_edge_result(...)`. Record/pick logic is
  untouched (normalization is additive and runs last).
- `app/engines/runners/cfb_runner.py` — **fixed model-selection drift**:
  `cmd_edge` now reads `model` (validated against `blend|elo|power`) and passes
  it to `blend_predict(...)`. Previously the requested model was ignored and edge
  always used the blend.
- `test_engines_contract.py` *(new)* — exercises `info`, `predict`, `edge`
  (manual), and `simulate` (WC/golf, tiny seeded) for every registered adapter.
  Missing data/odds = SKIP; contract violations = FAIL.

**Verified**

- `python3 test_engines_contract.py` → 12 pass · 2 skip · 0 fail (exit 0). Skips
  are WC and golf edge, whose local odds files are unfilled templates.
- CFB edge default (`blend`) output unchanged; `power` now differs
  (e.g. ML home 0.822 → 0.787) — matches the acceptance criterion exactly.
- Canonical fields present on every emitted edge row; original UI keys
  (`date`, `match`, …) preserved.
- No engine emits NaN/Inf (asserted by `assert_finite_json`).
- Regression suite green: `test_club_soccer`, `test_m2`, `test_m3`, `test_m4`,
  `test_m5`, `test_m6`, `test_m7` all pass.

**Rejected / deferred**

- Did *not* rewrite the subprocess runners to emit canonical rows directly —
  normalizing in the adapter keeps the runner JSON minimal and avoids editing
  four flat-module codebases. The adapter is the contract boundary.
- Golf `event_id` is currently just the player slug; proper tournament-scoped
  event identity is M4 (where golf settlement is also made event-safe).

## 2026-06-15 · M2 — Security & reliability hardening

**Goal:** shrink attack surface without changing any model output.

**Files changed**

- `app/security.py` *(new)*:
  - `redact()` — scrubs known stored/env key values, then masks any remaining
    20+ char key-looking token. Belt-and-braces for unknown keys too.
  - `collect_secrets()` — gathers concrete secrets (api_keys.json values + key
    env vars) to redact against.
  - `safe_runner_env()` — curated env allowlist (system essentials + the API-key
    env vars the engines read) instead of leaking the whole parent environment.
  - `safe_get()` — requests wrapper with timeout, provider label, redacted error.
- `app/engines/_subprocess.py` — hardened `run_engine()`:
  - rejects any command outside `ALLOWED_COMMANDS` *before* spawning;
  - checks the runner file exists;
  - uses `safe_runner_env()`;
  - strict finite-JSON validation of the result (`assert_finite_json`) — NaN/Inf
    or noisy stdout is a hard `RuntimeError`;
  - redacts stderr snippets and engine `error` strings.
- `app/server.py` — bounded Pydantic request models:
  - `EngineRequest.engine` must match `^[a-z0-9_-]{1,40}$` (path traversal /
    injection rejected at the boundary, 422 — never reaches the filesystem);
  - `params` serialized size capped at 50 KB;
  - numeric params (`sims, seed, kelly, min_edge, cut_rule`) clamped to ranges;
  - `BankrollAction.amount` and `SettingsPatch.default_kelly` range-bounded.
- `api_keys.py` — `save_keys()` now `chmod 0o600` (best-effort; no-op on
  Windows/unsupported FS).
- `preflight.py` *(new)* — offline report of per-engine data-file presence/age
  and which API keys are set (masked). Never makes a network call; exit 0 always
  so missing data can't block offline use.
- `test_security.py` *(new)* — 22 checks across all of the above.

**Verified**

- `python3 test_security.py` → 22 passed, 0 failed. Confirms: settings expose
  only masked keys; a synthetic runner error carrying a fake key is redacted in
  the raised error; bad/oversized requests rejected; sims/kelly clamped;
  unrelated env dropped while key env vars survive; key file is 0600;
  non-finite runner JSON rejected.
- No behavior change on default runs: contract test still 12 pass · 2 skip · 0
  fail; `test_club_soccer` (exercises the subprocess path) still green.

**Rejected / deferred**

- Did *not* wire every engine's existing network fetch through `safe_get()` —
  that touches four flat-module codebases and isn't needed for the default
  offline/manual runs the acceptance covers. The helper is in place; routing the
  live fetches through it is a follow-up (and a natural fit alongside M5 CLV).
- Kept the `safe_runner_env` allowlist generous (system + venv/conda vars) on
  purpose: a too-tight env risks breaking Python startup on some machines, which
  would be a worse failure than the leakage we're closing.

## 2026-06-15 · M3 — Validation gates across all engines

**Goal:** make "do not degrade modelling" enforceable for every engine, not just
World Cup.

**Files changed**

- `cfb/validate.py` *(new)* — walk-forward CFB validation, consolidating the
  useful parts of `predictor.py --backtest`, `blend_eval.py`, `ats_backtest.py`,
  `totals_backtest.py`:
  - Elo updated game-by-game; spread slope fitted only on seasons **before**
    `--since`; power refit per week with `asof = first kickoff` → no future
    leakage.
  - Metrics: `ml_brier`, `ml_acc`, `margin_mae`, `total_mae`, plus ATS ROI and
    totals ROI per disagreement threshold (vs `closing_spreads.csv` /
    `closing_totals.csv`).
  - Gate fails (exit 1) if Brier (+0.005) or margin/total MAE (+0.5pt) regress.
    ROI is recorded but **not** gated (too noisy). `--update-baseline` is the
    only way to loosen the baseline.
- `cfb/data/validation_baseline.json` *(new)* — stored baseline, window
  2023–2025, 2394 games: ml_brier 0.1885, margin_mae 12.79, total_mae 13.05.
- `validate_all.py` *(new)* — runs all four gates, each in its own
  cwd + PYTHONPATH (engine-folder isolation), writes `data/validation_suite.json`,
  prints a compact per-engine table, exits non-zero if any engine regresses or
  errors. Golf sims default to a small `--sims 5000` for a fast gate.

**Verified**

- `python3 validate_all.py --gate --sims 4000` → all four PASS (worldcup 1.0s,
  club_soccer 9.3s, cfb 3.6s, golf 45.3s; ~59s total). Summary JSON written.
- Negative test: tightening the CFB baseline `ml_brier` to 0.10 makes the CFB
  gate print FAIL and exit 1; restoring the baseline returns exit 0. Confirms the
  regression gate is real and the baseline isn't silently loosened.
- CFB walk-forward confirmed leakage-free (slope fit on `<since`, power refit
  per week with `asof`).

**Rejected / deferred**

- Did not gate on ATS/totals ROI — single-season betting ROI is too high-variance
  to use as a pass/fail signal; it's stored for visibility and trend-watching.
- Defaulted the CFB window to 2023–2025 (2394 games) over 2025-only (807): a
  larger sample makes the Brier/MAE baseline more stable while still being
  leakage-free and fast (~4s).

## 2026-06-15 · M4 — Shared bankroll, portfolio & settlement

**Goal:** one safer staking/settlement path for all engines.

**Files changed**

- `app/portfolio.py` *(new)* — suite-level risk caps (pure risk controls, only
  ever reduce a stake): `drawdown_factor()` brake + `apply_caps()` enforcing
  single-event (15%), correlated-per-engine (25%) and daily (40%) exposure
  against the pooled bankroll, accounting for already-open exposure.
- `app/bankroll_store.py`:
  - ledger extended backward-compatibly with `event_id, market, line, source,
    model, closing_odds` (`_CORE_COLS` + `_V3_COLS`); `load_ledger()` backfills
    missing columns as `""`, so old ledgers load unchanged.
  - `place_bets()` rewritten: dedupes on `(engine, event_id, side)` (legacy
    `home/away/side` still honored), runs `apply_caps()` before the pooled-funds
    clamp, and writes the new provenance columns. Accepts an optional `peak`.
  - `settle()` gains `dry_run=True`: computes every verdict and the resulting
    bankroll but writes nothing, returning a per-bet `preview`.
- `app/engines/golf.py` — **event-safe settlement**. Replaced "grade everything
  against the single latest event" with `_completed_events()` (all events, sorted
  by end date) + a per-bet rule: grade only against the earliest completed event
  **on/after the bet's reference date** whose field actually contains the
  participant(s). A stale/future outright stays open. Golf records now stamp the
  placement date so `event_id = date|player` is week-distinct and settlement has
  a date floor.
- `app/engines/{worldcup,cfb,club_soccer}.py` — each `edge()` now flags
  `recommended` on the rows recording would place (the engine's own selection),
  and recording places exactly those rows + writes `source`/`model` — no separate
  ad-hoc filter at record time. Golf already recorded by `recommended`.
- `app/server.py` — new bankroll action `settle_preview` → `settle(dry_run=True)`.
- `test_bankroll.py` *(new)* — 17 checks on temp files.

**Verified**

- `python3 test_bankroll.py` → 17 passed: legacy ledger loads + V3 cols
  backfilled; duplicate placement deduped; single-event exposure capped to ~15%;
  in-event golf bet settles while a stale future outright stays open; dry-run
  previews settlement and leaves ledger/bankroll untouched, then the real settle
  commits.
- Full regression: all 10 suites green (`test_engines_contract`, `test_security`,
  `test_bankroll`, `test_club_soccer`, `test_m2`–`test_m7`).
- End-to-end smoke: `app.server` imports with the bounded models; a real CFB
  `edge()` flags 3/6 rows `recommended` with `event_id` + `stake_gbp`; the
  dashboard still builds against the extended ledger.

**Rejected / deferred**

- Golf `event_id` is a `date|player` key, not the ESPN numeric tournament id:
  the upcoming event isn't in `rounds.csv` at bet time and `field.csv` carries no
  id, so a numeric id can't be captured reliably. Settlement is made event-safe
  by **chronology + field membership** instead, which needs no fragile id mapping
  and directly satisfies the staleness acceptance.
- Left each engine's internal portfolio shaping (WC `edge.portfolio_size`,
  `golf/portfolio.py`) in place; `app/portfolio.py` is the shared backstop at the
  pooled-bankroll boundary, not a rip-and-replace — that keeps the validated
  per-engine staking intact while still enforcing suite-wide caps.

## Scope note

This pass delivered the M1–M4 risk-reduction core (the plan's recommended
time-box). M5–M9 (market blend + CLV, gated modelling upgrades, data provenance,
power-user UX, release docs) remain open. New leverage available for them:
`app/engines/contracts.py`, `app/security.py` (`safe_get`), `app/portfolio.py`,
`validate_all.py`, and `preflight.py`.
